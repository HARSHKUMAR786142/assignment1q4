About this code: 
This is a web-based visual tool (pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript) that lets students or learners: Create processes and resources. Simulate allocation and resource requests. Detect deadlocks using a wait-for graph. Run Banker‚Äôs Algorithm to check if the system is in a safe/unsafe state. Apply deadlock recovery strategies like aborting a process or preempting resources. Visualize everything with interactive graphs and logs. üëâ In short: It‚Äôs a teaching tool to demonstrate how deadlocks happen, how to detect them, and how recovery works.

‚öôÔ∏è What the Code Does (Step by Step)

User Interface (HTML & CSS) Header ‚Üí Title and a Reset button. Left panel (Configuration & Controls): Add processes (P1, P2, ‚Ä¶). Add resources (R1, R2, ‚Ä¶). Select a process ‚Üí allocate/request/release resources. Run Banker‚Äôs Algorithm or Detect Deadlock. Recovery section: abort process or preempt resource. Shows system state matrices (allocation and request). Right panel (Visualization): SVG graph ‚Üí process nodes (circles) and resource nodes (rectangles). Edges for allocations and requests. Logs of all actions. Notes for learners. Footer ‚Üí Hints on how to create a deadlock cycle.

Adding Processes & Resources User types process name (e.g., P1) ‚Üí added to list. User types resource name (e.g., R1) ‚Üí added to list. Code prevents duplicates. UI is refreshed with new dropdowns.

Simulating Operations Allocate ‚Üí Give a resource to a process. Request ‚Üí A process asks for a resource. Release All ‚Üí Clears a process‚Äôs allocations and requests.

System State Matrices The code renders two tables: Allocation Matrix ‚Üí shows which process holds which resources. Request Matrix ‚Üí shows pending requests. This mirrors how OS textbooks explain deadlocks.

Graph Visualization (SVG) Processes = circles on the left. Resources = rectangles on the right.

Edges: Process ‚Üí Resource (allocation). Resource ‚Üí Process (request). If a deadlock cycle is detected, the involved processes are highlighted in red.

Deadlock Detection (Wait-for Graph) Builds a graph of process ‚Üí process dependencies: If P1 is waiting for a resource held by P2 ‚Üí edge P1 ‚Üí P2. Runs a DFS cycle-detection algorithm. If a cycle exists ‚Üí deadlock is reported and highlighted.

Banker‚Äôs Algorithm Implements a simplified Banker‚Äôs algorithm (single-unit resources). Steps: Tracks available resources. Computes if there exists a safe sequence of processes. If yes ‚Üí system is SAFE, shows sequence. If no ‚Üí UNSAFE, potential deadlock.

Deadlock Recovery Two strategies are simulated: Abort process ‚Üí Kills a process, releases all its resources back. Preempt resource ‚Üí Takes one resource away from a victim process. Logs show what happened.

Logging Every action (adding process, allocating, detecting deadlock, running Banker, recovery, etc.) is logged with timestamps.

Seed Example When the page loads, it auto-creates a classic deadlock scenario: P1 holds R1 and requests R2. P2 holds R2 and requests R1. This creates a cycle ‚Üí deadlock. This helps learners immediately see how deadlocks occur.

Why This Was Generated: This project was made as an educational visualizer for Operating Systems concepts: Students often struggle with abstract concepts like deadlock, safe states, and Banker‚Äôs algorithm. Teachers need a simple, browser-based tool with no installation required. This code helps learners see: How processes and resources interact. How deadlocks form (cycles). How to detect and recover from them. It‚Äôs a teaching demo tool ‚Üí can be used in class or assignments.

How It Works Internally: Input: User adds processes/resources, simulates allocations/requests. State Tracking: Code updates allocation/request matrices. Graph Drawing: SVG shows process-resource graph dynamically.

Detection: Wait-for graph cycle detection ‚Üí deadlock check. Banker‚Äôs Algorithm ‚Üí safety check. Recovery: Aborts or preempts resources. Output: Updates graph, matrices, and logs.

Summary: What it is: A browser-based Deadlock & Recovery Visualizer for OS. What it does: Lets you simulate process-resource allocation, detect deadlocks, run Banker‚Äôs algorithm, and apply recovery. Why made: For teaching/learning OS concepts without complex setups. How it works: Uses JS arrays for system state, cycle detection for deadlock, Banker‚Äôs for safety, SVG for visualization, and logs for tracking.
